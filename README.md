# Week 1 Homework Challenge

## Description

I was tasked with editing the HTML code and corresponding CSS code to have more comprehensive semantic tags as well as make the links functionable.

## Installation

I updated the title from "webpage" to something resembling what was on the webpage. I replaced the first "div" tag with a "header" tag. I replaced the second "div" tag with a "nav" tag. I changed the "header div" selector on the CSS sheet to "header nav". I removed the list tags and kept the link anchor tags. I updated the CSS sheet by removing the "header div ul", "header div ul li", and "a" selectors and replaced them with a "header nav a" selector. I added "section id" tags to each content section and alt names to each image. I changed the names of the three individual class elements to the same name "content-section" and replaced each class in the CSS sheet with one class with the same name. I replaced the next "div" tag with an "aside" tag. I repeated the section id, image alt names, and class changes in the aside section. I changed the last "div" tag to a "footer" tag and updated the copyright year to 2023.

## Usage
